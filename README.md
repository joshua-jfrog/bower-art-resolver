# bower-art-resolver
Artifactory resolver for Bower, a custom resolver dedicated to integrate with Artifactory.

## Installation
`npm install -g bower-art-resolver`

This resolver depends on [bower-art](https://github.com/JFrogDev/bower-art/tree/bower-poc); a temporary custom bower with the **pluggable resolvers mechanism** currently in [pending pull request](https://github.com/bower/bower/pull/1686).  

## Client Configuration

Edit your ~/.bowerrc and point the registry to Artifactory:
```json
{
  "registry": "http://<domain>/artifactory/api/bower/<bower-repo>"
}
```

For non Anonymous access:
